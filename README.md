## 🎯 The Problem We Are Addressing

Farmers across India often:

- Sign land or supply contracts without fully understanding legal clauses  
- Face exploitation due to complex terminology  
- Lack real-time access to simple legal explanations  
- Do not have multilingual digital support  

Legal language complexity → Information imbalance → Financial vulnerability.

> A structured, secure, and accessible AI-driven legal assistance system for rural India.

It simplifies contracts, highlights risks, and provides contextual guidance — all in a farmer-friendly digital interface.
